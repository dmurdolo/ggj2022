  Config: 'I see you''ve been going around my town talking to my people, my voters,
    who elected me to the lofty office of Town Mayor. What have you been saying?

    me!

    [Yes] Wouldn''t dream of it

    {townAComplete}

    [No] What if I
    am?


    <Yes>

    <No>

    The
    people will never vote for you!'
